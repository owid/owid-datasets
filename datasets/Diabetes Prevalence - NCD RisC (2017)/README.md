Diabetes is defined as fasting plasma glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L, or history of diagnosis with diabetes, or use of insulin or oral hypoglycaemic drugs.

The data is taken from 751 population-based measurement surveys and studies, which included over 4 million participants aged 18 years or older. The studies covered 146 (73%) of the 200 countries and territories for which estimates were made. These 146 countries contained 90% of the world's adult population in 2014.
