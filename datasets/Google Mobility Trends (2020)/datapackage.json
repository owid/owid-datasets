A baseline day represents a normal value for that day of the week. The baseline day is the median value from the 5‑week period Jan 3 – Feb 6, 2020.\n\nFor each region-category, the baseline isn’t a single value—it’s 7 individual values. The same number of visitors on 2 different days of the week, result in different percentage changes. So, we recommend the following:\n\n– Don’t infer that larger changes mean more visitors or smaller changes mean less visitors.\n– Avoid comparing day-to-day changes. Especially weekends with weekdays.\"\n\nMobility trends are measured across six broad categories:\n(1) Residential: places of residence.\n(2) Grocery & Pharmacy stores: places like grocery markets, food warehouses, farmers markets, specialty food shops, drug stores, and pharmacies.\n(3) Workplaces: places of work.\n(4) Parks: places like local parks, national parks, public beaches, marinas, dog parks, plazas, and public gardens.\n(5) Transit stations: places like public transport hubs such as subway, bus, and train stations.\n(6) Retail & Recreation: places like restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, theme parks, museums, libraries, and movie theaters.\n\nThe 'Residential' category shows a change in duration—the other categories measure a change in total visitors.",
