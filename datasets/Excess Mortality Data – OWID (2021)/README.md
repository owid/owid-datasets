# Excess Mortality Data – OWID (2021)

All-cause mortality data is from the Human Mortality Database (HMD) Short-term Mortality Fluctuations project and the World Mortality Dataset (WMD). Both sources are updated weekly.

We do not use the data from some countries in WMD because they fail to meet the following data quality criteria: 1) at least three years of historical data; and 2) data published either weekly or monthly. The full list of excluded countries and reasons for exclusion can be found in this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JPMtzsx-smO3_K4ReK_HMeuVLEzVZ71qHghSuAfG788/edit?usp=sharing.

For a full list of source information (i.e., HMD or WMD) country by country, see: https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid#source-information-country-by-country.

HMD has deaths data for all ages and broken down by broad age groups, while WMD has data for all ages only.

We use the reported weekly or monthly deaths data from HMD and WMD, and the projected deaths for 2020 from WMD, to calculate P-scores. The P-score is the percentage difference between the reported number of weekly or monthly deaths in 2020–2021 and the projected number of deaths for the same period based on previous years.

We calculate the number of weekly deaths for the United Kingdom by summing the weekly deaths from England & Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.

For a more detailed description of the HMD data, including week date definitions, the coverage (of individuals, locations, and time), whether dates are for death occurrence or registration, the original national source information, and important caveats, see the HMD metadata file at https://www.mortality.org/Public/STMF_DOC/STMFmetadata.pdf.
