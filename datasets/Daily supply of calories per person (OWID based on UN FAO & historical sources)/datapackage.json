  "description": "Data for all countries spanning the timeframe from 1961 is based on daily caloric supply (kcal/person/day) as reported by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Daily caloric supply is defined as the average per capita caloric availability. Note that this indicates the caloric availability delivered to households but does not necessarily indicate the number of calories actually consumed (food may be wasted at the consumer level). FAO data can be found at its FAOstats database (food balance sheets): http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS [accessed 2017-07-18]\n\nData from 1961-1991 for Post-Soviet states are assumed to be in line with reported data for the USSR over this period.\n\nData for the USSR is determined to be highly uncertain, and likely represents an overestimate of caloric supply prior to its dissolution. The FAO admits its estimates of USSR availability are highly uncertain, and comparative sources suggest the same.
