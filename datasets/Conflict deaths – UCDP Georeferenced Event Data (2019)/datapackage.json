Taking the 'best' deaths estimates, we have aggregated these to country-year observations.\n\nUCDP documentation makes it clear that the dataset is intended to have global coverage since 1989, except for the case of Syria since 2011. As such, any country-year in which no events are recorded in the data were attributed zero deaths, except for Syria in this period.\n\nDeath rates are calculated using UN population figures.",
