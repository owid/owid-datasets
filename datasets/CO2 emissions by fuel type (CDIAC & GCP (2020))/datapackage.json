  "description": "Data on emissions by fuel type from the Global Carbon Project is available at the global level only. For the global series, GCP data is used from 1959 onwards; pre-1959 data is sourced from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC).\n\nNational and regional data is sourced from CDIAC. This is available until the year 2014 only.\n\nData has been converted by Our World in Data from tonnes of carbon to tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) using a conversion factor of 3.664.\n\nSome historical emissions data from CDIAC are given as negative values. These data points have been normalized to zero by default.\n\nData from pre-1959 is sourced from the archived Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC).
