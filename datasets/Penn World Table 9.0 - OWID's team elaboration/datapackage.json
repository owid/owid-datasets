Calculated multiplying PWT(9.0)'s variable \"rgdpo\" by 1.000.000.\n\nTotal GDP (expenditure): Expenditure-side real GDP at chained PPPs (in unit 2011US$). Calculated multiplying PWT(9.0)'s variable \"rgdpe\" by 1.000.000.\n\nPopulation: Population. Calculated multiplying PWT(9.0)'s variable \"pop\" by 1.000.000.\n\nLiving Standard GDP per Capita: Per Capita expenditure-side real GDP at chained PPPs.
