  "description": "The NHGRI program describes genome sequencing costs relative to two metrics, quoted below:\n\n\"(1) \"Cost per Megabase of DNA Sequence\" - the cost of determining one megabase (Mb; a million bases) of DNA sequence of a specified quality;\n\n(2) \"Cost per Genome\" - the cost of sequencing a human-sized genome.\"\n\nCost data from the NHGRI is presented either biannually or seasonally for each year. Here, we have summarized this data on an annual basis by calculating the lowest yearly cost.\n\nThe number of DNA base pairs sequenced per US$ was calculated by dividing 1 by the metric, \"Cost per Megabase of DNA Sequence\", and multiplying by 1 million.",
