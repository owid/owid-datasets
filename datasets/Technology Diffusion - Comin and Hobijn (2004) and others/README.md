# Technology Diffusion - Comin and Hobijn (2004) and others

A similar dataset was previously assembled by Horace Dediu who writes at: http://www.asymco.com/author/asymco/. We are thankful for Horace Dediu's generosity in making his dataset available to us. We have tracked down all of his original sources and assembled our dataset based on these original sources.
