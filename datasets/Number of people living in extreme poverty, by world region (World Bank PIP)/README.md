# Number of people living in extreme poverty, by world region (World Bank PIP)

PIP provides regional aggregate figures for the number of people living below the international poverty line of int-$ 1.90 using 2011 PPPs.

Unfortunately, for certain regions and years the data survey coverage is too low and the results are suppressed.  From 1990 onwards  it is only for South Asia and South Saharan Africa (on different years) that regional estimates are sometimes missing.

For these years we calculate the number of poor in the region as the difference between the estimated total number of poor across the world and the sum of the number of poor across all other regions.

Prior to 1990 estimates for more than one region are missing, precluding this method.
