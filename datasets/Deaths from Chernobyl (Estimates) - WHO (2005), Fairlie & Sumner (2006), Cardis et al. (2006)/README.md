# Deaths from Chernobyl (Estimates) - WHO (2005), Fairlie & Sumner (2006), Cardis et al. (2006)

Estimates of the total number of deaths from the Chernobyl nuclear incidents remain contested: we have therefore included a series of published estimates to cover the range of considered values.

WHO (2005a) refers to the number of deaths (up to 4000) estimated in the populations with highest exposure to radioactive fallout from the incident. WHO (2005b) add this to further estimates by the WHO [not included in its report] on the potential death toll in individuals beyond proximate areas.

Fairlie & Sumner (a) and (b) are represent their published lower and upper estimates, respectively.
