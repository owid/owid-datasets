# Deaths per TWh from low-carbon energy (Sovacool et al., 2016)

Number of deaths attributed to energy-related accidents of low-carbon energy sources, measured as the number of deaths per terawatt-hour of production.

Sovacool et al. (2016) developed a database of energy-related accidents over the period from 1950 to 2014. They define an accident as: "an unintentional incident or event at an energy facility that led to either one death (or more) or at least $50,000 in property damage."

This database was developed based on a series of academic databases (including ScienceDirect and EBSCO host) as well as the internet (using Google and Safari).
