# Total population - Gapminder

Gapminder dataset. Available online at http://www.gapminder.org/.

Population data by country is taken from Version 5 of Gapminder. This provides data by country from 1800 through to 2100.

From 1950 to 2015, estimates come from the UN Population Revision (2017), and projections to 2100 from the UN Population Revision (2017) medium scenario.

Full documentation of Gapminder's sources and process are available here: https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd003/.
