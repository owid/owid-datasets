# Human Rights Scores – Schnakenberg and Fariss (2014), Fariss (2019)

The dataset used here is "Latent Human Rights Protection Scores Version 3" (v3.01, 2019-05-28), first developed by Schnakenberg and Fariss (2014) and subsequently updated by Fariss (2019). 

The Latent Human Rights Protection Scores—which we simply call Human Rights Scores here—have values from around −3.8 to around 5.4 (the higher the better).

To construct the Human Rights Scores, Fariss (2019) uses data from nine sources. These are listed here under "Data publisher's source". For more details on these sources, see Fariss's (2019) Appendix A, "Observed Human Rights Variables Descriptions and Citations", available at https://static.cambridge.org/resource/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20190514094205785-0852:sup-mat:20190514094205785-0852:S000305541900025Xsup001.pdf
