  "description": "Data denotes the range of CO2 mitigation curves for a range of 'peak scenarios': scenarios are based on the necessary annual emission curves necessary if emissions mitigation was to start (soon peaking then falling) in a given year. \n\nFor example, 'Start in 2010' marks the necessary future emissions pathway to have a >66% chance of keeping global average temperatures below 1.5C warming if global CO2 emissions mitigation had started in 2010, very quickly peaking then falling. \n\nData is sourced from Robbie Andrew, and available for download here: http://folk.uio.no/roberan/t/global_mitigation_curves.shtml\n\nHistorical emissions to 2017 are sourced from CDIAC/Global Carbon Project, projection to 2018 from Global Carbon Project (Le Quéré et al. 2018).\n\nGlobal cumulative CO2 emissions budgets are from the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C (Rogelj et al 2018): 420 GtCO2 for a 66% of 1.5°C and 1170 GtCO2 for a 66% of 2°C. Mitigation curves describe approximately exponential decay pathways such that the quota is never exceeded (see Raupach et al., 2014). ",
