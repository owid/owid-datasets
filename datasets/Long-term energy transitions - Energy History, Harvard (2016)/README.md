# Long-term energy transitions - Energy History, Harvard (2016)

Data published by the Joint Center for History and Economics has been sourced from a range of authors and publications, referenced below.

The authors note:

1. Firewood consumption has been calculated in a variety of ways by the various authors. Sometimes totals are not included for the later part of the series, even if IEA or other organizations report it. The same applies to other forms of energy such as incinerated waste products;

2. this work considers as primary electricity the following sources: geothermal (only for electricity); hydropower, nuclear power, wind, photo­voltaics, tidals, wave and solar thermal (only for electricity). Generally electricity that has been derived from firewood, wastes, or other biomass is not included in ‘primary electricity’ as this entails thermal losses;

3. non-energy uses of oil and natural gas are excluded from the totals.
