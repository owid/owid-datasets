# Methyl chloroform consumption - UNEP

Consumption is a parameter that gives an idea of the presence of ODS on the market and tracks progress in phasing out these chemicals. It is calculated for each calendar year and is mainly defined as 'production plus imports minus exports' (quantities destroyed or used in certain applications like feedstock or quarantine and pre-shipment services are subtracted where relevant). As such, its formula can yield a negative number when substances are produced and imported in quantities that do not compensate for the amounts exported or destroyed. This usually happens when export or destruction take place for ODS that were previously on the market in the EEA-33 (stocks). Additionally, different substances have different ODP values. If consumption is calculated in ODP tonnes, a negative value is also obtained when production/imports take place for low-ODP substances and export/destruction take place for high-ODP substances. The latter is the current situation due to the fact that certain high-ODP substances are produced in the EU as by-products which, in general, are stocked before being destroyed.
