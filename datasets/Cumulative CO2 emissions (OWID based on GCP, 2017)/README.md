# Cumulative CO2 emissions (OWID based on GCP, 2017)

Cumulative carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions have been calculated by Our World in Data based on annual CO₂ emissions published by the Global Carbon Project (GCP). By summing the annual emissions to a given year we have calculated the cumulative total. 

Data converted from carbon into carbon dioxide (using conversion factor of 3.67). Data for Australia appears to be negative from 1851-1858; for clarity, these figures have been renormalised to zero.
