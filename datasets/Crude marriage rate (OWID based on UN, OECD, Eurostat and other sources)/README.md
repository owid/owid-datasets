# Crude marriage rate (OWID based on UN, OECD, Eurostat and other sources)

Estimates rely on data from multiple sources:
- For European countries, the data comes from the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Marriage_and_divorce_statistics#Fewer_marriages.2C_more_divorces">Eurostat dataset</a>.
- For the US the series is composed of data taken from three sources: <a href="https://hsus.cambridge.org/HSUSWeb/HSUSEntryServlet">Carter et al. (2006)</a> for the period 1920 - 1995; the <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2006/compendia/statab/126ed/vital-statistics.html">US Census Bureau (2007)</a> for the period 1996 - 2004; and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/marriage-divorce.htm?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fnchs%2Fmardiv.htm">CDC</a> for the period 2005 to present.
- For other non-European countries that are OECD members, the data comes from the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/els/family/database.htm">OECD Family Database</a>.
- For all other countries the data comes from the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/dataset/marriage/data.asp">UN World Marriage Database</a> ,

Notes regarding comparability:
1. The US Census Bureau (2007) figures include estimates for some States through 1965 and also for 1976 and 1977 and marriage licenses for some states for all years except 1973 and 1975. From 1978, estimates include nonlicensed marriages in California. Prior to 1960, figures exclude Alaska and Hawaii. 
2. The CDC has revised the rate of marriages for 2016 due to revised figures for Illinois.  Rates for 2001-2009 have also been revised and are based on intercensal population estimates from the 2000 and 2010 censuses. Populations for 2010 rates are based on the 2010 census.
3. For Canada, data include the legal union of two persons of the same sex in some provinces and territories from 2003 onwards, and in all of Canada from 2005 onwards. 
4. Data for New Zealand include civil unions.
5. Germany includes the German Democratic Republic. This series was favoured instead of 'Germany (until 1990 former territory of the FRG)' as when compared with the OECD series matched more closely.
5. Footnote by Turkey. The information in this document with reference to « Cyprus » relates to the southern part of the Island. There is no single authority representing both Turkish and Greek Cypriot people on the Island. Turkey recognizes the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Until a lasting and equitable solution is found within the context of United Nations, Turkey shall preserve its position concerning the “Cyprus issue”.
6. Footnote by all the European Union Member States of the OECD and the European Commission.. The Republic of Cyprus is recognized by all members of the United Nations with the exception of Turkey. The information in this document relates to the area under the effective control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus.
7. Estimates from the UN World Marriage Database have a 10-year reference period. This means that estimates labeled as "1985", for example, correspond to data collected over the period 1980-1989.
