# Labor productivity in cotton spinning (Chapman (1972))

The easiest way to illustrate the improvements in labor productivity in cotton spinning over time is to reproduce data on labor productivity from Catling’s study of The Spinning Mule, from which the measure of OHP (operative hours to process 100 lbs of cotton) is applied to other technologies, as shown. [Please see table 2 on page 20 for the original data.]

Catling’s study of The Spinning Mule provides a historical introduction of the invention of the spinning mule in the 18th century. The spinning mule was worked by hand with the spinner manually controlled all its operations. It was around 1825 that Richard Roberts invented the ‘quadrant winding motion’ that enabled the machine to operate automatically.
