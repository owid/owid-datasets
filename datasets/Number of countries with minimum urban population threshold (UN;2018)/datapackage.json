This is highly variable across countries. This data presents the number of countries with a given minimum threshold of inhabitants needed for it to be defined an 'urban area'. For many countries, there is no defined threshold based on inhabitants; other metrics such as population density, infrastructure, or even pre-defined cities may be used.\n\nNote that some countries with minimum inhabitant thresholds noted here also include additional qualities (such as population density) to be met.",
