# Trust in Govt – OECD

The source reports that the OECD average is based on 28 countries, as it excludes countries with more than two consecutive time-points missing in the series (i.e. Iceland, Luxembourg, Norway, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia and Switzerland). Among countries where a single time point is missing in the time series, the average of the two adjacent years is taken. The OECD 28 average is population-weighted.
