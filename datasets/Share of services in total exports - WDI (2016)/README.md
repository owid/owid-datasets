# Share of services in total exports - WDI (2016)

In the series for China, the original data shows a large temporary shift over the period 1997-2002. We have contacted the source for clarification, but in the meantime we have suppressed these observations from our data, since we have reasons to believe the shift is a mistake in the source. The deleted observations are: (1997, 40.95%; 1998, 44.13%; 1999, 44.09%; 2000, 41.42%; 2001, 43.20%; 2002, 41.26%).
