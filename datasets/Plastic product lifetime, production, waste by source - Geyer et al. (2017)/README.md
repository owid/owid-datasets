# Plastic product lifetime, production, waste by source - Geyer et al. (2017)

Data is given as mean product lifetimes of plastic products (measured in years), plastic production, and plastic waste by industrial sector/use (measured in tonnes per year). 

Data is also given for primary production and plastic waste by polymer type. Polymer types are as follows:
- LDPE: Low-density polyethylene
- HDPE: High-density polyethylene
- PP: Polypropylene
- PS: Polystyrene
- PVC: Polyvinyl chloride
- PET: Polyethylene terephthalate
- PUT: Polyurethanes
- PP&A fibres: Polyphthalamide fibres
- Other polymers
- Additives
