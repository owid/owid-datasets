# Alcohol consumption by type since 1890 (Alexander & Holmes, 2017)

Breakdown of alcohol consumption by type (wine, beer and spirits) in select high-income countries where data is available. This is presented as each beverage's share of total pure alcohol consumption.

The original paper presents these trends as 5-year averages (e.g. 1980-1984). In this data we allocate a single year to each 5-year average – the last year of the period (1984 in this case).
