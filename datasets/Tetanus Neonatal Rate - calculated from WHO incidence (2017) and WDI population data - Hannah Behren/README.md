# Tetanus Neonatal Rate - calculated from WHO incidence (2017) and WDI population data - Hannah Behrens

Neonatal tetanus incidence per 1,000,000 people based on WHO neonatal tetanus incidence dataset 2017 (already on grapher) and WDI total population dataset (already on grapher). 

No population data was available for Niue (all years), Kuwait (1992-1994), Eritrea (2013-2016).. The neonatal tetanus incidence was zero. Population size does therefore not matter to calculate the rate, as it will be zero regardless of the population size.

No population data was available for Swaziland. It was therefore excluded.
