The definitions vary from year to year, but the pre-1940 samples have generally used a definition of group quarters that includes units with 10 or more individuals unrelated to the householder.\"\n\nWe have excluded those recorded to be living in institutions, other group quarters, and additional households under the 2000 definition.",
