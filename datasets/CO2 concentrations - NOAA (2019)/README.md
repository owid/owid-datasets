# CO2 concentrations - NOAA (2019)

Annual mean CO₂ concentrations in the atmosphere, measured in parts per million (ppm).

Long-term global average atmospheric concentrations of CO₂ have been combined using several sources, all available at the NOAA/ESRL Global Monitoring Division.

Very long-term data from ice cores – specifically the Dome C core – has been made available from the NOAA here: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/17975. In this original dataset, some years had multiple measurements (taken at different points of the year). To normalize this to a single year, where several measurements were available, we took the average of these concentration values.

Dome C data has been used until the year 1958. 

Data from 1959 through 1979 have been obtained by C. David Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and were obtained from the Scripps website (scrippsco2.ucsd.edu).

Data from 1980 onwards is sourced from NOAA's Mauna Loa monitoring station, available at: https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/data.html
