# Hypothetical global CO2 emissions - CDIAC (2014)

Data is based on the hypothetical scenario where the total global population had the same carbon dioxide production footprint as the average citizen of a given country.

Figures were derived by multiplying the average per capita CO2 footprint (sourced from CDIAC, referenced below) in 2014, by the UN estimated global population in 2014 of 7,265,786,000.
