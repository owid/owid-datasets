# Heights of Early Europeans - based on Hermanussen (2003) and the NCD RisC (2017)

This series combines figures from two published datasets.

Data on human heights in Early Europeans in the Eastern Mediterranean region was sourced from Hermanussen (2013). Stature of Early Europeans. These heights are provided for specific historical periods: where values are provided over a time range (for example, 10000-8000 BC), we have have allocated a date in the middle of this range (9000 BC, in this example).

To compare how historical heights have evolved into the 19th and 20th century, we have combined this series with data for Europe and Central Asia in the period 1896-1996 from the NCD RisC.
