  "description": "<strong>Definition and sources by country.</strong></br>\nThe estimates of average age at marriage in this dataset correspond to what is known as \"singulate mean age at marriage\". This is an estimate of the average number of years lived by a cohort of women or men before their first marriage. It is an indirect estimate, obtained from survey data on marital status by age.\n\nThe source of the estimates is the UN World Marriage Database (2019). \n\nThe UN World Marriage Database combines multiple sources for each country, including both census and survey estimates. For comparability, we have chosen to use only one source per country, favouring the source that provides the longest time series for each country. \n\nThe following is a list of underlying sources, from most to least coverage: UNSD, DHS_STATcompiler, National Statistics, MICS, the US Census Bureau, INED, Eurostat, and IPUMS. \n\nA full breakdown of the source used for each observation in the UN dataset can be found <a href=\"https://owid.cloud/app/uploads/2020/01/un-smam-19-metadata_country_stan.csv\">here</a>.\n\n\n<strong>Further notes on Singulate Mean Age at Marriage: </strong></br>\n<em>The Singulate Mean Age at Marriage is derived from the proportion of single persons of each sex in successive age groups. The main assumption involved in this computation is that change in the proportion single from age x to x+1 is a measure of the proportion of a birth cohort who married at age x. The methodology enables computation of mean age at marriage of persons (male or female) aged 15 years and above before they attain the age of 50. In other words, it provides an estimate of the average number of years lived in the never married status by those who marry before the age of 50.</em>",
