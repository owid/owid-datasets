# CO2 emissions (Aggregate dataset (2020))

This dataset has been compiled by Our World in Data based on several sources.

CO2 emissions data is sourced from the Global Carbon Project and the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC).
– Data from pre-1959 is sourced from the archived Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC). Reference: Tom Boden and Bob Andres (Oak Ridge National Laboratory); Gregg Marland (Appalachian State University). Available at: http://cdiac.ornl.gov/
– Data post-1959 is sourced from the Global Carbon Project. Global Carbon Project. (2019). Supplemental data of Global Carbon Budget 2019 (Version 1.0) [Data set]. Global Carbon Project. https://doi.org/10.18160/gcp-2019.

Data has been converted by Our World in Data from tonnes of carbon to tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) using a conversion factor of 3.664.

"Statistical differences" are referred to by the Global Carbon Project as the difference between global emissions and the sum of all national emissions plus bunker fuels: this discrepancy is therefore categorized as "statistical differences".

Our World in Data have renamed the category "bunker fuels" as "International transport" which includes emissions from international aviation and shipping. We have renamed this category for clarity.

Each country and region's share of global carbon dioxide (CO₂) has been calculated by Our World in Data based on annual national emissions data published by the Global Carbon Project (GCP). This is calculated as each country's share of the sum of all country emissions plus international aviation and shipping ('bunkers') and 'statistical differences'.

Our World in Data has calculated several additional metrics based on the following metrics:
– Energy consumption data from BP Statistical Review of World Energy: https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html
– Long-term GDP data from Maddison Project Database: https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/releases/maddison-project-database-2018
– Population data from the UN World Population Prospects and Gapminder.
