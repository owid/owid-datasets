# Long-term per capita fossil fuels - OWID based on UN, Gapminder, BP, Etemad & Luciana

Average per capita fossil fuel production - for coal, oil and gas - was calculated by OWID based on published population and national fossil fuel production data.

Per capita fossil fuel production was calculated by dividing national production of coal, oil or gas by the total population in any given year.

Population data was sourced from a combination of Gapminder sources (for data pre-1950), and from 1950 onwards was sourced from the UN Population Division's 2017 Revision.

Fossil fuel production data was sourced from a combination of sources.
