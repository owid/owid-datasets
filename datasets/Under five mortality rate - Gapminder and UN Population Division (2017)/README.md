# Under five mortality rate - Gapminder and UN Population Division (2017)

Dataset comes from Gapminder - Child mortality (version 10), the latest version as of 2019.

Gapminder's sources and methodology is well-documented in its dataset at: https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd005/

It notes its data sources during three key periods of time:

— 1800 to 1950: Gapminder v7  ( In some cases this is also used for years after 1950, see below.) This was compiled and documented by Mattias Lindgren from many sources, but mainly based on www.mortality.org and the series of books called International Historical Statistics by Brian R Mitchell, which often have historic estimates of Infant mortality rate which were converted to Child mortality through regression.

— 1950 to 2016: UNIGME, is a data collaboration project between UNICEF, WHO, UN Population Division and the World Bank. They  released new estimates of child mortality for countries and a global estimate on October 17, 2017, which is available at www.childmortality.org. In this dataset almost all countries have estimates between 1970 and 2016, while roughly half the countries also reach back to 1950.

— 1950 to 2100: UN WPP, World Population Prospects 2017  provides annual data for Child mortality rate for all countries in the interpolated demographic indicators, called WPP2017_INT_F01_ANNUAL_DEMOGRAPHIC_INDICATORS.xlsx, accessed on September 2, 2017.

There are significant uncertainties in data for many countries pre-1950. To develop full series back to 1800 for all countries, Gapminder combines published estimates within the academic literature and national statistics, with their own guesstimates and extrapolations for countries without published estimates. This series presents the selective Gapminder dataset: we have removed data points which were estimated by Gapminder with high uncertainty and instead only include those from published sources or the United Nations dataset. 

We also publish the full dataset from Gapminder for users looking for a complete series. However, we should highlight that some of these estimates have a high degree of uncertainty.
