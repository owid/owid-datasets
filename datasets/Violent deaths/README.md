# Violent deaths

This dataset contains estimates of the frequency of lethal violence in modern and prehistoric state and non-state societies, based on archaeological and ethnographic evidence.

For modern state societies, homicide rates are routinely published by statistical offices or other state agencies, and reliable data on war deaths are published by research institutes. For non-state societies, we generally have two different sources of information: for the more recent past (since the late 19th century), abundant ethnographic evidence is available; for the more distant past, we have evidence from archaeological sites and skeletal remains.

The main sources for this dataset are listed below. The original source of each data point is listed in the Data Sources section of the Ethnographic and Archaeological Evidence on Violent Deaths page.
