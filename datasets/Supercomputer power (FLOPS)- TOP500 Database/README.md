# Supercomputer power (FLOPS)- TOP500 Database

Data on supercomputer power is sourced from the TOP500 database which tracks and reports the 500 largest supercomputers on a bi-annual basis. 

Supercomputer power is measured in Floating-Point Operations per Second (FLOPS) is a measure of calculations per second for floating-point operations. Floating-point operations are needed for very large or very small real numbers, or computations that require a large dynamic range. It is therefore a more accurate measured than simply instructions per second.
