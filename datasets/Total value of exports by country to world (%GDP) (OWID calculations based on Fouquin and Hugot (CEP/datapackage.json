Bilateral trade flows are recorded in current British pounds.\n\nThe CEPII data source uses the IMF's Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS) dataset extensively from 1948 until the present day.\n\nWest Germany estimates have been used between 1950 - 1990, and Germany's trade estimates used before 1950 and after 1990.
