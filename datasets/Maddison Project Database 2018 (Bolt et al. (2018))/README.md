The original Maddison Project dataset expresses the population "in thousands". In our dataset we have multiplied it by 1000 to avoid expressing it "in thousands".

The Maddison region definitions were adapted from the source from Maddison (2010)'s homepage at: http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/oriindex.htm under the heading "Historical Statistics" and the file titled: Statistics on World Population, GDP and Per Capita GDP, 1-2008 AD (Horizontal file, copyright Angus Maddison, University of Groningen) 

To calculate average real GDP per capita across regions, we have calculated a population weight for each country per year by dividing country population in year x by the total regional population. This weight has been used to multiply real GDP per capita (in 2011US$, with multiple benchmarks) to give real regional GDP per capita weighted by population.
