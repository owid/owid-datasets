To the extent that the authors do not specify which sources were prioritised for each year/country, it is not possible for us to reliably extend the time series with newer data. For instance, the OECD Education at a Glance report (1998), which presents estimates for the years 1990 and 1995, suggests discrepancies with the values reported by Tanzi & Schuktnecht (2000) for 1993.",
