# Meat consumption in the USA (USDA, 2018)

Per capita meat availability in the United States. Per capita meat availability is typically used as an estimate for meat consumption, although it does not correct for consumption-level waste (households and retail). Actual meat intake will therefore be slightly lower but close to meat availability.

Figures are given in lbs and kilograms per person per year.

'Red meat' is the sum of beef, pork, sheep and veal, excluding offals.
