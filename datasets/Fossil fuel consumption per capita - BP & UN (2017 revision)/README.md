# Fossil fuel consumption per capita - BP & UN (2017 revision)

Per capita trends in fossil fuel consumption were calculated by OWID based on population data from the UN Population Division, and national fossil fuel data - coal, oil, and natural gas - from BP's Statistical Review of Global Energy.

Per capita consumption was calculated by dividing total population in any given year by a country or region's coal, oil or gas consumption.
