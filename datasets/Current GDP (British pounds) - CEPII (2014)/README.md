# Current GDP (British pounds) - CEPII (2014)

Due to the long-run nature of CEPII's time series, GDP estimates are compiled using a variety of sources. The top five sources, which together make up more than a third of the dataset (approx 11,864 observations out of 31,541) are from the following sources: World Bank (2015) (8513 obs); Mitchell (2017a,b,c) (1714); Barbieri and Keshik (2012) (1037 obs); Smits et al (2014) (335 obs); and Dincecco and Prado (2013) (265 obs). 

A comprehensive list of GDP sources and full references can be found here: http://www.cepii.fr/PDF_PUB/wp/2016/wp2016-14.pdf, Table 7, page 19. 

Similarly, CEPII's exchange rate variable is set to the British pound value of one local currency unit. Again, it draws on a range of sources of which the top five are reported here: International Monetary Fund (2012) (4394 obs); extracted from Wikipedia (2448 obs); Barbieri and Keshk (2012) (2005 obs); Officer (2014) (1752 obs); and Denzel (2010) (1750 obs).
