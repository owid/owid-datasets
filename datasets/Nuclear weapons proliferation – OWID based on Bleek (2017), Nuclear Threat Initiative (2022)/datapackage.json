  "description": "This dataset provides information on nuclear weapons states, using data from Bleek (2017), which we double-checked with information from the Nuclear Threat Initiative (2022) for recent years.\n\nThe dataset distinguishes between countries not considering (score 0), considering (score of 1), pursuing (score 2), possessing nuclear weapons (score 3). \n\nA country is coded as not considering nuclear weapons if it neither considers, pursues, or possesses nuclear weapons.\n\nA country is coded as considering nuclear weapons if its leaders explore whether it is possible and desirable for them to attempt to acquire nuclear weapons, or they work to increase their nuclear weapons capabilities, but without launching a dedicated program.\n\nA country is coded as pursuing nuclear weapons if it has an active program to acquire nuclear weapons or to obtain the ability to construct them on short notice.\n\nA country is coded as possessing nuclear weapons if it has a nuclear-explosive device that it can deliver. Conducting an explosive nuclear test is therefore neither sufficient nor nor necessary.\n\nBelarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine are not coded as possessing nuclear weapons because they never had operational control of the nuclear weapons left over from the Soviet Union.\n\nYou can read more about specific countries in the profiles by Bleek (2017) and the Nuclear Threat Initiative (2022) by following the links.\n\nYou can download the code and complete dataset, including supplementary variables, from GitHub: https://github.com/owid/notebooks/tree/main/BastianHerre/nuclear_weapons",
